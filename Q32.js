// Q32. Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that
// everyone has a unique username.
//• Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
//• Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also
// in the current_users list.
//• Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has,
// print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used,
// print a message saying that the username is availa
var currentUsers = ["Muneeb", "Khalil", "Zain", "Sidra", "Marvi"];

    return currentUsers.some(function (user) { return user.toLowerCase() === username.toLowerCase(); });
