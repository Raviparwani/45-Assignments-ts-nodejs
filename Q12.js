//11. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
// print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be 
// personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ["Shahbaz Ahmed", "Ghouse Ahmed", "Waqas Ahmed"];
var message = "Do you like to play Cicket ";
console.log(names[0] + " " + message);
console.log(names[1] + " " + message);
console.log(names[2] + " " + message);
